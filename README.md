# SentriAI: Early Dropout Prediction 🎓

## 📖 Executive Summary
SentriAI is an AI-driven system designed to predict and mitigate early student dropout rates in educational institutions. By leveraging machine learning, SentriAI identifies at-risk students, enabling proactive interventions and improving overall student retention.

## 🚩 Problem Statement
High student dropout rates negatively impact educational institutions by reducing funding and hindering student success. Current methods often rely on lagging indicators and manual processes, leading to delayed interventions. 

**SentriAI addresses this by:**
* Providing early and accurate dropout predictions.
* Automating the identification of at-risk students.
* Facilitating proactive interventions and support.

## 🎯 Goals & KPIs
* **Goal:** Reduce student dropout rates and improve retention.
* **Success Metrics:** Dropout rate reduction (%), Prediction accuracy (%), and Intervention effectiveness (%).
